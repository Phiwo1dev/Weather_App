# Weather App

##Overview
The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific city. Users can enter a city name, and the app will provide information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a visual representation of the weather condition using cloud icons.

## Features
Weather Data: The app fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Dynamic Cloud Icons: The app dynamically changes the cloud icon image to represent the current weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy, drizzle, mist).
User-Friendly: Error handling ensures that users receive clear error messages if a city is not found or if there are issues with the API request.

## Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling the user interface and making it responsive.
JavaScript: For client-side functionality, including user input handling and API requests.
OpenWeatherMap API: Used to fetch weather data based on user input.

## Usage

Enter a city name in the input field.
Click the "Search" button.
The app will display weather information for the specified city.
If the city is not found or there are issues with the API request, you will see a clear error message.

## Development

If you want to further develop or modify this project:
